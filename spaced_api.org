Wow such less much wrong:

* Versus just ad-hoc look up for code
* Use cases
** Learn new branch of mathematics
** Prepare for interviews
* Prototype with pandas and scikit-learn, some python sdk
* Get top usages from Github or somewhere else
* Create for org-drill
* Discussion with Will
(14:34:40) Robert Kozikowski: I plan to write something that will:
1. Extract pydocs from python library
2. Look up top 25% used methods from this library from github
3. Create flash cards :D
(14:35:15) Robert Kozikowski: I think it could be more effective than adhoc googling I have been doing so far
(14:35:26) Robert Kozikowski: It would give you an idea what to look for before you start googling
