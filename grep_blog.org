* Ease of installation
All tools I am investigating are easy to install on Linux and Mac using apt-get/yum/brew/etc.
** Installation on Windows
With new Windows 10 "Ubuntu" compatibility installation of all tools should be as easy as on Linux.

If you have perl installed (comes with cygwin) ack installation is quite easy.
Just download single perl file mentioned in http://beyondgrep.com/install/ and put it somewhere in $PATH.

If you don't have or want cygwin installed, pt should be easy to install, but I did not try it.
** Installation on Linux without access to apt-get
grep and git grep should be already accessible on any Linux.
You can try to build pt and ag from source, but you may hit some missing libraries.

ack installation in is quite easy, just download single perl file mentioned in
http://beyondgrep.com/install/ and put it somewhere in $PATH.
* One regex flavor to rule them all - PCRE
One annoying thing about regular expression is that every language implements them in their own way.
It's enough to look at the table at [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_regular_expression_engines][wikipedia.]] 

Thankfully, there is a way out - use PCRE or perl regular expressions as often as possible.
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl_Compatible_Regular_Expressions#Differences_from_Perl][Perl or PCRE regexp differences are minimal.
]]Almost all tools and languages support perl regular expressions nowadays in some form, mainly thanks to PCRE.
The same can't be said about any other regex engine.
What's more, perl regexps are one of the most powerful regex flavors.

** Perl regex support in various tools
*** grep and git-grep
Newer versions of grep and git-grep have a -P flag. 
*** ag
ag "natively" supports PCRE.
*** ack
ack "natively" supports perl regexps (it's written in perl).
*** pt
pt is the only investigated grep-like tool that does not support perl regexps.
*** Command line
Even if perl gets lots of hate, [[http://lifecs.likai.org/2008/10/using-perl-like-awk-and-sed.html][you can use it as a better sed and awk replacement on the command line.]]
*** Editors
**** Emacs
[[*Emacs integration][I will be talking about emacs in particular in the later section.]]
**** Vim
[[http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Perl_compatible_regular_expressions][Wiki mentions PCRE support in some form, but I did not try it, as I primarily use evil mode in emacs.]]
*** Different programming languages
- [[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-pcre/0.6][Python]] and [[http://www.pcre.org/original/doc/html/pcrecpp.html][C++]] have pcre wrappers.
- [[http://jregex.sourceforge.net/doc-index.html][Java library JRegex]] claims perl regex support.
- As PCRE is a C library, you can always just call native code to use the PCRE directly (e.g. JNI in Java).
