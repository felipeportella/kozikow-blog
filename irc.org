#+TITLE: Set up ERC, Emacs IRC client, with automated windowed layout and connection
#+AUTHOR: Robert Kozikowski
#+EMAIL: r.kozikowski@gmail.com
* Introduction
I've set up an Emacs function =my-open-irc= that connects to all IRC channels I am interested in and sets up a 2x2 layout with the channels:
#+ATTR_HTML: :border 2 :rules all :frame all
|--------------------------------+-----------------------|
| #ensime/ensime-emacs (gitter)  | #emacs (freenode)     |
|--------------------------------+-----------------------|
| #ensime/ensime-server (gitter) | #archlinux (freenode) |
|--------------------------------+-----------------------|
See the screenshot:
[[file:irc_setup.png][file:~/git_repos/github/kozikow-blog/irc_setup.png]]

=my-open-irc= called at any time either (re)connects to irc and sets up the layout or restores the old buffers.
It also saves anything I have been doing before under register ?8 so I can come back to it with =C-x r j 8=.
If you are not aware of this functionality, [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/WindowsAndRegisters][see the documentation of window-configuration-to-register]].

You can think of as =my-open-irc= as "turn IRC on" and =C-x r j 8= as "turn IRC off", all from within emacs.
I have bind the =my-open-irc= to some key with the =global-set-key=.
* Erc support for sasl
Erc support for sasl is a bit hacky.
circe supports it better, but circe support for gitter didn't work and I gave up after 15 minutes of debugging.

To set up ERC with sasl I did:
- Install erc with package-install. erc-sasl is not in any emacs repo, so I prefered to install erc to avoid manual updates.
- From erc-sasl repository, copy just erc-sasl file: https://github.com/joseph-gay/erc-sasl/blob/sasl/erc-sasl.el .
- In erc-sasl add =(require 'erc)= and anywhere in your emacs config =(require 'erc-sasl)=.
* gitter irc support.
Follow instructions from https://irc.gitter.im/ to get the irc password.
** Random channel join
Beware that gitter joins you to more channels than I want.
Strangely it didn't auto connect to channels after just connecting to gitter channel, but when I connect to one of the channels it connects me to all of them.
I suspect it's based on the list or gitter channels I joined through the website.

It caused some bugs with my code on =erc-join-hook=.
I simply check if joined channels are in my-erc-channel with =(-contains-p my-erc-channels (buffer-name))=.
* Problem with auto connection
For some reason, even if config tells erc to auto connect to channels it did not.
It is quite simple to do it manually simply by:
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :results output
  (switch-to-buffer "irc.freenode.net:6667")
  (erc-cmd-JOIN channel))
#+END_SRC
* My configuration
Code is not production quality, but it's single purpose. I know I shouldn't hardcode passwords in my .el config, but I do not expose my config and irc is not sensitive.

Just add below to your emacs config, add your nick/password in my-join-irc, and call my-join-irc.
Joining my take a few seconds, but you don't need to do anything manually.
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :results output
  (setq my-freenode-channels '("#archlinux" "#emacs"))
  (setq my-gitter-channels '("#ensime/ensime-emacs" "#ensime/ensime-server"))

* Adapting config to your needs
** Different channels and account
I choose servers to connect to and auth method in my-join-irc.
Channels are a bit scattered due to freenode connection bug.
** Different layout
If you want different layout take a look at =my-setup-window-layout=.
I just call the methods I would be calling when setting this layout up and calling them with =call-interactively=.
I would set up an layout manually, and just look up functions using =C-h k=, and put them in elisp with =call-interactively=.
Similar concept is offered by [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/KeyboardMacros][Emacs keyboard macros]], but we depend on hooks for timing, so we can't just use the macro.
** Line length
Default line wrapping and timestamps does not work well with windowed IRC layout.
I disabled the timestamp "on the right" and disabled the line wrapping.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :results output
  (erc-fill-mode -1)
  (setq erc-insert-timestamp-function 'erc-insert-timestamp-left)
#+END_SRC
** Adjust notifications
ERC by default have quite noisy notifications, especially for freenode chanells.
See https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ErcChannelTracking#toc6 .
** Auto re-connect
By default you need to guess when ERC lost connection and reconnect it.
=my-maybe-reconnect-irc= works ok for me.
* How I use it
- Start emacs and call =my-open-irc=. It opens 2x2 layout with 4 irc chanels.
- Go back to old windows using =C-x r j 8=.
- At any time, call =my-open-irc= to inspect irc again and =C-x r j 8= to go back to work.
