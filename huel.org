#+TITLE: On nutritionally complete powdered food (UK focused)
#+AUTHOR: Robert Kozikowski
#+EMAIL: r.kozikowski@gmail.com

* Introduction
Food is currently one of the least optimised areas of my life.
I spend lots of time and money on it. I very often end up eating too much of unhealthy food.
Nutritionally complete powdered food is very optimal when you consider time and price.
It is also relatively healthy, especially considered alternative fast food I would be eating.
The price you pay is taste - you end up eating the same shake drink every time.
I still intend to eat normal food in social situations, but possibly replace all of the meals I would be eating alone by nutritionally complete powdered food.
I will be analysing the powdered food products in general, and looking [[*Review of individual products][at some products in particular]].

You can also read this post in the [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kozikow/kozikow-blog/master/huel.org][org mode format.]] This post is also just my personal notes about the subject, so I intend to keep updating this post after publishing.
* Possible benefits
** Save time
This advantage is pretty obvious.
Buying ingredients and preparing a healthy meal takes enormous amount of time.
Even buying prepared food sometimes takes time, as you need to decide where to go, or leave a flat and break your coding flow.
** Save money

**** TODO Subway
** Lose weight
*** TODO Easier to count calories
*** TODO Make your brain not recognise food as available source of pleasure
** TODO Potentially more nutritious than alternative fast foods
* Possible problems
** Will I get bored by the same taste?
*** TODO Further reading
[[https://www.reddit.com/r/soylent/comments/3e6xz3/huel_vs_soylent_taste/][Huel vs Soylent taste]]
** Is it really nutritionally complete?
*** Macro nutrients
*** Micro nutrients and absorbability
Folk knowledge says that vitamins from raw fruits and vegetables are better absorbable than vitamin blends.
After some reading[1], it seems to depend on vitamin type. Chelates would be as absorbable as the real thing, but are expensive. 
I need to read more about vitamin types or find someone knowledgeable to be able to judge vitamin blends used by meal replacement products.

In case of long term usage, it's a good idea to familiarise yourself with vitamin deficiency symptoms[10].
** Can it satiate hunger (i.e. "fill you up")?
** Are there any chemical components that can be dangerous in the long term?
Those products mostly consists of natural ingredients. They even don't contain preservatives.
The biggest suspicion is various types of sweeteners. You can always drink it without sweetener, but good luck.
The sweeteners used in Huel that I looked at, Aspartame[2] and Sucralose[7], appear to be safe and well researched.
** Unknown long term effects of eating "not real food"
Long term effects of Soylent and therefore Huel have not been studied yet[1].
Medical meal replacements have been around for a while.
*** Microbial health
I found a study being performed[8] on UC Berkeley, but it's not ready yet.
*** Other factors
Reports of long term users have been generally positive in different areas[9].
