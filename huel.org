#+TITLE: On nutritionally complete powdered food (UK focused)
#+AUTHOR: Robert Kozikowski
#+EMAIL: r.kozikowski@gmail.com

* Introduction
This is an early draft. Read at your own risk.

Food is currently one of the least optimised areas of my life.
I spend lots of time and money on it. I very often end up eating too much of unhealthy food.
Nutritionally complete powdered food is very optimal when you consider time and price.

In theory, you would make a single shake that will contain all of the micro and macro nutrients you need to stay healthy.
Given that the same can't be said about the fast food I sometimes throw into myself, even if it's not perfect it's better than the alternatives.

The price you pay is taste - you end up eating the same shake every time.
I still intend to eat normal food in social situations, but possibly replace all of the meals I would be eating alone by nutritionally complete powdered food.
I will be analysing the powdered food products in general, and looking [[*Review of individual products][at some products in particular]].

You can also read this post in the [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kozikow/kozikow-blog/master/huel.org][org mode format.]] This post is also just my personal notes about the subject, so I intend to keep updating this post after publishing.
* Possible benefits
** Save time
This advantage is pretty obvious.
Buying ingredients and preparing a healthy meal takes enormous amount of time.
Even buying prepared food sometimes takes time, as you need to decide where to go, or leave a flat and break your coding flow.
** Save money
*** Cost of powdered food
**** Huel (1.33 GBP per 500 kcal)
The biggest package of 112 meals with recurring order is 56000 kcal for 149.85 GBP from the official website[4].
Delivery is free to UK.
#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :exports both
  print "{} GBP per 500 kcal".format(149.85 / (56000 / 500))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

**** Joylent (1.17 GBP per 500 kcal)
From the official website[6]:
150 GBP for the biggest package of 90 meals.
5 GBP per bag.
Each bag have 2119 calories.
Shipping is free.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :exports both
  print "{} GBP per 500 kcal".format((500.0/2119) * 5)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

**** Ambronite (6.68 GBP per 500 kcal)
Subscription for 10 Ambronite meals costs 75.65 EUR + 11.90 EUR delivery from the official website[3].
Currently 1 GBP costs 1.31 Eur.
Each ambronite meal have 500 calories.

Official Soylent website do not ship to UK.
I found some "actibest" soylent on Amazon.
It does not list kcal per "meal", but 500 is a standard.
The best I found sells 42 meals for 109 GBP + 7.91 GBP delivery[5].
#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :exports both

** Lose weight
It's worth noting that [[*Can it satiate hunger (i.e. "fill you up")?][worse satiation]] can lead to increased weight, if you are not paying attention to calories.
*** Easier to count calories
Window between starving and not losing weight is quite easy to miss without counting calories.
Writing down how many carrots you just ate and looking up their calories is very tedious task.
It's much easier with nutritionally complete powdered food.
*** Make your brain not recognise food as a available source of pleasure
Yes, I like food. And that's the problem.
If you don't enjoy your food as much and it's just an efficient calories delivery method,
you're less likely to experience your brain saying: "come on, order this Lamb Biryani from online takeaway".
If you only accept Huel et al. shake as the only accessible evening snack, you're less likely to have the evening snack.
** Potentially more nutritious than alternative fast foods
Powdered meals are still a new area and are not fully developed yet.
They are probably worse than the cooked meal with steamed vegetables and lean meat.
However, considering the fast food alternatives they are a very attractive option.
* Possible problems
** Can it satiate hunger (i.e. "fill you up")?
I find that eating same amount of calories of "real" food makes me less hungry than Huel and similar products.
Part of not being hungry is just a feeling of full stomach.
I am more hungry than after a real meal with equivalent calories.
It's slightly better with Huel than other drinks, due to low GI carbs and high protein ratio.

Even if I start to feel that my stomach is empty I don't experience other effects of hunger like
brain fog or worse focus. Maybe your body needs time to adjust the hunger indicators?

*** Satiation hack: Mix with a fruit
In my opinion, one of primary causes of worse satiation is caused by shake not being "solid" enough.
Blending a 450 kcal shake with a banana works well for me. Single banana is just 100 kcal[16].

I only have my subjective opinion behind this, but I think that shake and banana work together in a "synergy".
I.e. satiation of those two things together is higher than just a sum of satiation of banana and satiation of a shake.
The shake misses the solidness, while banana misses proteins and fats. 

If you are worried about the GI of banana, adding it won't simply average the GI of a shake with a GI of banana.
GI of mix will likely be better than the weighted average of GI of individual components[15].
*** Satiation hack: Make it warm
It may be psychological conditioning, but I found out that the warm shake make me
feel more full. I simply add warm water to my shake. It also reduces lumps and make the powder easier to dissolve.
*** Satiation hack: Make it denser
IMO the denser the shake the more satiating it feels.
Sadly, increase density also increase amount of lumps (not dissolved pieces of powder).
Good blender reduces the lumpiness. 
I recommend not going for the official water:powder ratio, but going for the smallest water amount that avoids lumps.
** Will I get bored by the same taste?
Huel offers product without added taste and you can add your own taste afterwards.
There are multiple alternative products, e.g. Joylent offer 8 different tastes.
I think that solution of Huel/Joylent/etc mixed with a fruit or vegetable like Banana, 
Mango or Avocado in a blender could be a good solution for the boring taste.
** Is it really nutritionally complete?
*** TODO Macro nutrients
*** TODO Micro nutrients and absorbability
Folk knowledge says that vitamins from raw fruits and vegetables are better absorbable than vitamin blends.
After some reading[1], it seems to depend on vitamin type. Chelates would be as absorbable as the real thing, but are expensive. 
I need to read more about vitamin types or find someone knowledgeable to be able to judge vitamin blends used by meal replacement products.

In case of long term usage, it's a good idea to familiarise yourself with vitamin deficiency symptoms[10].
** Are there any chemical components that can be dangerous in the long term?
Those products mostly consists of natural ingredients. They even don't contain preservatives.
The biggest suspicion is various types of sweeteners. You can always drink it without sweetener, but good luck.
The sweeteners used in Huel that I looked at, Aspartame[2] and Sucralose[7], appear to be safe and well researched.
** Unknown long term effects of eating "not real food"
Long term effects of Soylent and therefore Huel have not been studied yet[1].
Medical meal replacements have been around for a while.
*** Microbial health
No variety in various factors like fiber can negatively impact your gut microbial health.
I found a study being performed[8] on UC Berkeley, but it's not ready yet.
*** Other factors
Reports of long term users have been generally positive in different areas[9].

* TODO Conclusion
- Only replace meals I would be eating alone.
- Not go 100% Huel, try to have at least one real meal per day.
- Take a blood test after a few months
