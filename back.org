Sorry for late reply, I don't use twitter regularly and I don't have notifications.
I need to set up https://github.com/hayamiz/twittering-mode.

The current version, (A bit hacky and uses my crappy, "this is not how you lisp", parentheses):
https://github.com/kozikow/kozikow-blog/blob/master/back.el

I tried a few alternatives, like https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/BackButton or https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/BackButton or global mark ring,
but all of them either didn't work or required manual adding to the ring.
I got convinced in the meetup pub that it would be worth it to improve a few things and package it. 
I may do it this Sunday (on Saturday I'm coming to the Tower).
Before release:
1. I want to have "multiple" mark rings, at least "visit" and "edit" mark ring. Emacs already can support it with things like =make-ring=. I actually use it for "forward" button.
2. Make it more idiomatic lisp and "unhack" a few things. 
3. Do not add to the ring if the relative line difference is too small.

After release:
1. Custom pop, i.e. go back to the previous mark within the same projectile project.
2. Currently, if you use multiple windows and go "back", rather than switch windows it opens position
from your old buffer in the current window. This may not be as easy to fix, as this is the problem
on the "go to mark" level, rather than in my code.
