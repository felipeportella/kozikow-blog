#+TITLE: Top emacs packages used in github repos
#+AUTHOR: Robert Kozikowski
#+EMAIL: r.kozikowski@gmail.com
* Introduction
[[https://github.com/blog/2201-making-open-source-data-more-available%20][Today github announced new BigQuery tables]] that let you query data about github repos using the BigQuery.
I found about it from [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12004442][hacker news.]] [[http://google-opensource.blogspot.co.uk/2016/06/github-on-bigquery-analyze-all-code.html][Also see announcement from Google.]]
The killer new feature is the ability to query the contents of all files stored on github.

I will use it to list top packages required in elisp files on github.
If you are impatient you can jump directly to [[*Results][Results]].
To run a query go to [[https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/dataset/bigquery-public-data:github_repos][BigQuery console]] and click "Compose Query".

[[https://gist.github.com/abo-abo/9607099][In contrast to old BigQuery with top starred repos]] I will list all packages required in any
elisp file, rather than just repositories written in emacs lisp. This will include built in
emacs packages or packages not stored on github.
* Bias towards repos with license
As [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12004644][this hacker news]] post mentions, only repos with license are indexed.
That will bias the result towards packages rather than personal emacs configs people put on github.
* Query on sample_contents
sample_contents only contains 10% sample files from top 130k repos according to stars.
It also contain pre-joined data between tables contents and files.
It's good for data exploration before running the bigger query on the full dataset.

#+BEGIN_SRC sql :results output
  SELECT
    line,
    COUNT(DISTINCT(sample_repo_name)) as count
  FROM (
    SELECT
      SPLIT(content, '\n') line,
      sample_repo_name
    FROM
      [bigquery-public-data:github_repos.sample_contents]
    WHERE
      (sample_path LIKE '%.el'
        OR sample_path LIKE '%.emacs')
    HAVING
      line LIKE '(require%)')
  GROUP BY
    1
  ORDER BY
    count DESC
  LIMIT
    10;
#+END_SRC

Top 10 results:
| line                 | count |
|----------------------+-------|
| (require 'cl-lib)    |    32 |
| (require 'ert)       |    22 |
| (require 'cl)        |    20 |
| (require 'comint)    |    19 |
| (require 'org)       |    14 |
| (require 'font-lock) |    13 |
| (require 'compile)   |    11 |
| (require 'eieio)     |    10 |
| (require 'package)   |     9 |
| (require 'dash)      |     9 |

Since the top entry got only 32 hits it made me worry that sample size is too small.

Only 266 emacs repos are included in sample_contents:
#+BEGIN_SRC sql :results output
  SELECT
    COUNT(DISTINCT(sample_repo_name))
  FROM [bigquery-public-data:github_repos.sample_contents]
  WHERE
  (sample_path LIKE '%.el' OR
      sample_path LIKE '%.emacs')
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  266
#+END_EXAMPLE

That made me think that I need to query the unsampled data.

* Query on full, unsampled, data
contents contains all files, but require join with files to get file path.
My query:

#+BEGIN_SRC sql :results output
  SELECT
    TOP(line, 5000),
    COUNT(*) AS c
  FROM (
    SELECT
      SPLIT(contents.content, '\n') line,
      contents.id AS id
    FROM
      [bigquery-public-data:github_repos.contents] AS contents
    JOIN (
      SELECT
        path,
        id
      FROM
        [bigquery-public-data:github_repos.files]
      WHERE
        path LIKE '%.el'
        OR path LIKE '%.emacs') AS files
    ON
      (contents.id == files.id)
    WHERE
      contents.content CONTAINS '(require \''
    HAVING
      LEFT(line, 10) == "(require '"
      AND RIGHT(line, 1) == ")");
#+END_SRC

Thanks to all optimizations getting top 5000 packages takes only 60 seconds.

I have been getting a few errors, including =Error: Resources exceeded during query execution.= for a while.
It required a couple of BigQuery tricks to make it work
- TOP/COUNT is faster than GROUP BY/ORDER/LIMIT.
- Filtering data prior to join in sub-query reduces memory usage.
- Regexps and globs are expensive. LEFT/RIGHT is much faster.
- Avoid scanning files without .el or .emacs extension (thanks to filtering done by join).

* Things to improve 
In sampled query I counted unique repos that reference given library.
In full query I just counted number of times given line appeared in any emacs file.
It is better to count unique repos, but calculating distinct repos on a full contents would require additional join.
